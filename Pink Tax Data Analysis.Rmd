# 79.8% of participants in the control condition chose women's shampoo. Participants in the pink tax condition are 79% less likely to choose women's shampoo compared to control (1 - 0.21 = 0.79). 


```

A logistic regression was conducted to examine the effect of pink tax information on product choice, specifically comparing the control condition (condition 1) and pink tax condition (condition 2) on participants' likelihood of choosing women's shampoo versus other options.

The analysis revealed a significant effect of condition on product choice (Î² = -1.57, SE = 0.22, z = -7.13, p < .001). In the control condition, 79.8% of participants chose women's shampoo. However, exposure to pink tax information significantly reduced this preference, with participants in the pink tax condition being 79% less likely to choose women's shampoo compared to those in the control condition (OR = 0.21, 95% CI [0.13, 0.32]).

The analysis revealed no significant difference between the two conditions (Î² = -0.39, SE = 0.24, z = -1.62, p = .106). In the pink tax condition (reference group), 45.2% of participants chose women's shampoo. Participants in the design condition showed a numerically lower preference for women's shampoo, with 32.3% making this choice, but this difference was not statistically significant (OR = 0.68, 95% CI [0.42, 1.08]).But this reveals that providing justifications from the design perspective may even result in lower purchase intention.

Participants in the color condition showed a very similar preference for women's shampoo at 40.4%, with this minimal difference not reaching statistical significance (OR = 0.82, 95% CI [0.51, 1.31]).

The analysis revealed a significant positive effect of the ingredient condition compared to the pink tax condition (Î² = 1.04, SE = 0.25, z = 4.19, p < .001). In the pink tax condition (reference group), 45.2% of participants chose women's shampoo. However, participants in the ingredient condition showed a substantially higher preference for women's shampoo at 67.4%, representing a significant increase in choice likelihood (OR = 2.83, 95% CI [1.75, 4.66]). This shows that ingredient may be a more justified reason for marketers to communicate when there are price premiums for women's products.

The analysis revealed a highly significant positive effect of the marketing condition compared to the pink tax condition (Î² = 1.27, SE = 0.26, z = 4.85, p < .001). In the pink tax condition (reference group), 45.2% of participants chose women's shampoo. However, participants in the marketing condition showed a substantially higher preference for women's shampoo at 74.4%, representing a dramatic increase in choice likelihood (OR = 3.55, 95% CI [2.15, 6.01]).

***Control vs. pink tax***

Significantly less likely to choose women's shampoo under the pink tax (45.2%) compared with under control (79.8%)

***Pink tax vs. pink tax with justifications***

- Insignificant but less likely to choose women's shampoo when there were justifications based on design & color
- Insignificant but more likely to choose women's shampoo when justified by fragrance
- Significantly more likely to choose women's shampoo when there is ingredient justification (70%) and marketing justification (74.5%), the latter is almost the same as those in the control condition --> suggesting that ingredient difference and branding are more reasonable justifications of price premiums. One is more like a rational appeal, the other is more like an emotional appeal. 


## Linear Regression - Conditions' Impacts on Buying Intentions for Women's shampoo

* I used buying intention for women's shampoo minus buying intention for men's shampoo to construct the variable - Buying intention for women's shampoo (so positive when prone to women's shampoo, 0 when no difference, and negative when prone to men's shampoo)


### Control vs. pink tax
Results showed a significant effect of pink tax information on buying intention differences, F(2, 422) = 29.05, p < .001, RÂ² = .121. Control participants favored women's shampoo (M = 2.41), while pink tax participants showed 1.83 points lower preference (Î² = -1.83, p < .001). Income had a marginally significant positive effect (Î² = 5.89e-06, p = .070). Pink tax awareness substantially reduces preference for women's products even controlling for economic factors.

## Control vs. Pink Tax with Justifications

### Logistic Regression - Product choice
Compared with those under the control condition, participants showed significantly less product choice of women's shampoo under the pink tax with design justification, color justification, and the fragrance justification.

Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant difference between control and particiapants under the pink tax with ingredient justification (p = 0.0513), and participants under the pink tax with marketing justification (p = 0.29). The latter one is very impressive.

## Pink Tax vs. Pink Tax with Justifications on Similarity, Estimated Costs, and Price Fairness

### Perceived Similarity

There is no significant difference of perceived similarity of women and men's shampoo under the design and color justifications compared with the pink tax condition.

The perceived similarity is significantly lower under the ingredient justification condition (p<.001), the fragrance justification condition (p<.001), and the marketing justification condition (p<.001) compared with the pink tax condition (p =0.04).

The perceived similarity may explain the product choice, as when the participants perceive the products are less similar (like under the ingredient justification), they showed higher buying intentions for women's shampoo. But even if they perceive two products less similar under the fragrance justification, this cannot explain why they don't show higher buying intention under this condition. Intestingly, the perceived similarity of two products approach the calibration, suggesting that similarity is a relatively weak explanatory factor for participants' high buying intentions for women's shampoo under the marketing justification.

### Estimated costs

The estimated costs difference (women-men) are significantly higher in the ingredient justification condition (p = 0.025), but no significant difference was found for other conditions. This suggests that apart from similarity, consumers may perceive products with different ingredients having higher manufacturing costs. Also the cost difference cannot explain the marketing condition's impact.

### Price Fairness

No difference for design justification and fragrance justification.

Significantly more unfair for color justification (p = 0.012), consistent with the lower buying intentions.

## Mediation Models

### Perceived similarity as a mediator

#### Product choice

The perceived similarity has no use on the product choice under the design justification,  color justification, and fragrance justification conditions, but it fully mediates the ingredient justification on the product choice (i.e., under the ingredient justification, consumers tend to perceive products as more different, contributing to higher buying intentions for women's shampoo). There is a weak mediation of similarity on marketing message condition's impact on product choice (the direct effect is much stronger). 

Mediation analysis revealed complete mediation, with a highly significant indirect effect (ACME = 0.174, p < .001) and no significant direct effect (ADE = 0.067, p = .225). The mediator explained 72.1% of the total treatment effect (p < .001), indicating that the treatment condition influences the outcome primarily through its effect on the mediator rather than through direct pathways.

### Estimated cost as a mediator

#### Product choice

Insignificant for design, color, fragrance, and marketing justifications. 

Partial mediation for the pink tax with the ingredient justification - Mediation analysis revealed partial mediation, with both significant indirect (ACME = 0.033, p = .033) and direct effects (ADE = 0.205, p < .001). The mediator explained only 14.0% of the total treatment effect, indicating that while the proposed mediational pathway is statistically significant, the majority of the treatment's influence (86%) operates through alternative mechanisms not captured by this mediator. The strong direct effect suggests additional mediators or pathways should be explored to fully understand how the treatment influences the outcome. Consistent with the full mediation of similarity.

### Perceived price fairness as a mediator

#### Product choice

No effect for design and fragrance.

Negative full mediation of color justification (i.e., color justification leads to lower perceived fairness, contributing to lower product choice). 

For ingredient, Mediation analysis revealed substantial partial mediation, with both significant indirect (ACME = 0.077, p = .001) and direct effects (ADE = 0.172, p < .001). The mediator explained 30.8% of the total treatment effect, indicating that the proposed mediational pathway accounts for nearly one-third of how the treatment influences the outcome. While the direct effect remains larger (69%), the mediator plays a substantial and significant role in the treatment mechanism.

For marketing message, Mediation analysis revealed strong partial mediation, with highly significant indirect (ACME = 0.076, p < .001) and direct effects (ADE = 0.221, p < .001). The mediator explained 25.7% of the total treatment effect (p < .001), indicating that the proposed mediational pathway accounts for more than one-quarter of how the treatment influences the outcome. While the direct effect remains larger (74%), the mediator plays a substantial and significant role in the treatment mechanism.
