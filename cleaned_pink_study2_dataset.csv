While men and women are equal they are not the same. I don't think stereotyping has much to do with it. Many women may enjoy an ornate shampoo container and this may be a predominantly  feminine nature. There is nothing stopping a man who feels the same to buy a so called shampoo catering to the female sensibilities either. We may be sometimes reading too much into these things especially because there are real issues like wage inequality among sexes that exists in our societies and these trivial issues may be distracting us from them."
